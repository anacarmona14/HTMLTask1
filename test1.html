            <h3>What's free will?</h3>
            <p> <strong><em>Free will:</em></strong> is the ability to make choices and decisions that are not
                predetermined or predetermined by external forces. <br>
            <div> It is a concept that has been debated for centuries, but is considered by many to be an integral part
                of human life. Free will allows individuals to choose their own paths and make decisions based on their
                personal preferences, values, and morals.</p>

            <h3>What does the bible say?</h3>
            <p> <strong> <em>The Bible:</em></strong> Generally speaks positively about free will. The biblical writers
                believed that humans have the power to choose their own destiny and that the choice to live a life of
                obedience to God gives us the greatest joy and satisfaction. For example, in Deuteronomy 30:19-20, the
                Lord says: “I call heaven and earth as witness today against you, that I have set before you life and
                death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live.” This
                passage emphasizes our ability to make choices and provides encouragement to make good choices.</p>

            <h3>Free will is usally understood as the key to crafting our own future</h3>
            <p> In <strong><em> Today's world </em></strong> it's assumed that free will gives us the power to make
                decisions that can shape our future. That we have the freedom to choose our own paths, from small
                choices like what to eat for dinner, to larger ones like where to go to college or who to marry. <br>
            <div> Ultimately, free will is supposed to provide us with the ability to determine our destiny and create

            <p> It is <strong><em>believed</em></strong> by many that our decisions and choices play a role in what our
                destiny will be, but at the same time, there are many factors outside of our control that can affect our
                destiny as well. <br> Ultimately, free will gives us the power to choose our paths, but life, and the
                outcome of those choices may still be unpredictable.</p>
